Design:

- Write EDF and labels to disk within a user-specified dirname
    - this can be modified/initalized in the get started page
    - the configurations will be specified in the same page
    
- each page is dependent on a Session/Analysis having been created
    - user picks their analysis from the sidebar
        - triggers session initialization from Sessio Manager object
        - global warnings/errors depending on validation of the configurations
