        This application needs to know a few details about your data before we can get started
        with your analysis. This is where you can specify things like which channels you'll
        be exploring and letting the application know what they are. Configurations need to be 
        specified for both your EDF data as well as any label data (if you will be training your
        own models). The returned config files have custom file extensions of `edfyml` and 
        `labelyml`, but this is just for file type detection; the configurations themselves are 
        simply YAML.
